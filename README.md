This project is a Machine Learning bootcamp created by 42 AI.

## Module05 - Stepping Into Machine Learning
Get started with some linear algebra and statistics

Sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, vectors and matrices operations.
Hypothesis, model, regression, loss function.

## Module06 - Univariate Linear Regression
Implement a method to improve your model's performance: gradient descent, and discover the notion of normalization

Gradient descent, linear regression, normalization.

## Module07 - Multivariate Linear Regression
Extend the linear regression to handle more than one features, build polynomial models and detect overfitting

Multivariate linear hypothesis, multivariate linear gradient descent, polynomial models.
Training and test sets, overfitting.

## Module08 - Logistic Regression
Discover your first classification algorithm: logistic regression!

Logistic hypothesis, logistic gradient descent, logistic regression, multiclass classification.
Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

## Module09 - Regularization
Fight overfitting!

Regularization, overfitting. Regularized loss function, regularized gradient descent.
Regularized linear regression. Regularized logistic regression.
